Types of Exception

There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked where error 
is considered as unchecked exception. The sun microsystem says there are three types of exceptions:

    Checked Exception
    Unchecked Exception
    Error
	

checked: extend throwable class and error these are checked at complie time

unchecked: extend run time exception These are checked at run time

error: Irecoverable


Scenario
a=50/0 arithmetic excelption

String s=null; //null pointer exception`

String s="abc";
int i=Integer.parseInt(s); //number format exceptiom

array:
int a[]=new int[5];
a[10]=50; //array index out of bound
