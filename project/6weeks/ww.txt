Stream

A stream is a sequence of data.In Java a stream is composed of bytes. It's called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.

In java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with console.

1) System.out: standard output stream

2) System.in: standard input stream

3) System.err: standard error stream




OutputStream vs InputStream

The explanation of OutputStream and InputStream classes are given below:
OutputStream

Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination, it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
InputStream

Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source, it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.

Let's understand working of Java OutputStream and InputStream by the figure given below.
