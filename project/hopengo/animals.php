        <h3>Pitbull</h3>
        <p>Our Dogo Pitbull. He is 100% deaf so was unworthy to use for breeding or fighting. He was in the pond and had two days to live. Our rescue team in Ludhiana,saved him. He lived there for about 6 months when I came out to volunteer. I fell in love instantly and even more so, loved his deafness. He now knows a full set of sign commands and is our big lap dog. Who says money can’t buy love, when all you have to do is pay an adoption fee for something so wonderful?”.</p>

        <h3>Chad</h3>
        <p>This is Chad’s story: He and his mate, Clarisse, were abandoned at their house by their family. It wasn’t just the two of them, though. There were bigger dogs and, in the fight for survival and to protect Clarisse, Chad was badly bitten by one of the other dogs and it quickly became infected. Luckily, a neighbor was aware of their situation and called animal control. While that call is not always a good one for most dogs, it was Chad’s saving grace. </p>

        <p>“This is Riley! We adopted him last summer. He was rescued from Patiala road , and had mange at only a few months old. We came across his profile on  rescue group’s page, and knew he felt like a good fit. He was brought up to Ludhiana in August, and as soon as he came out of the truck to meet us, he started rolling around for belly rubs and gave kisses. He’s adjusted to his new home very well, and loves playing in the shelter!.</p>

        <p>This is my 10+ year old Kirby! We volunteer at a HOPE shelter and they brought this little calf in who had been dumped in the mountains. He has chronic dry eye and needs eye drops and medications several times a day so they said he was “unadoptable.” But we fell in love with him and we fought to adopt him. We won and he is now part of my welfare society.” .</p>

        <p>Remmy was found by the HOPE Society as a stray with a broken leg in April 2014. Unfortunately for Remmy, his leg couldn’t be saved. Our team adopted him in May 2014 after a friend of ours posted his photo on Facebook. Two days later, we hospitalized him and he’s been the perfect cow!Thanks to our HOPE society who is standing with us in our bad times.</p>

        <p>Pacino was brought in to animal hospital to be euthanized for being “too aggressive” after he was used as a bait dog in Talwara. We decided to rescue him because when we met him that day he licked my face & we knew he was an angel. He had extensive surgery and we took him to HOPE . About 1 year later on the right, he is my pride and joy and the sweetest couch potato WE know..</p>

        <p>Our sweet Otis (formerly known as Chubby) was found at a local rescue near our home. When his mommy was pregnant with him and his litter, the owner’s child was struck by a car. The family knew their child would need constant care, so the mommy was surrendered with the children.Our HOPE Ngo were never horse owners in our lives. We took the trip to see him, and he peed on my shirt and sat right by me. I feet as if he was actually picking us. We knew that it was a done deal for us. </p>

        <p>This is our Phoenix! We chose that name for a reason…he was owner surrendered to a shelter when he was only 11 weeks old in Ludhiana and had 3 days to find a home or he would be euthanized. We couldn’t get his sweet little face out of my head and I knew I had to save him! With the help of (we believe) some people, we adopted him and he made his way up to HOPE. He had a bad case of demodex mange with a bacterial infection on top of that, but it wasn’t anything that some love and medicine couldn’t fix! .</p>

        <p>“This is our boy Wesson. The top picture is the day after my team found him bleeding and shaking from fear in an animal control cage. When our team member saw him at animal control she called the founder of HOPE and immediately had him moved over to their facility for medical care. They discovered he had been shot in his back and had bullet fragments still inside him. They performed surgery on him to remove the fragments..</p>
